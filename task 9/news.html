<p class="content">SEP 19, 2019  BETHANY KWOKA | @BKWOKA<br><br>The use of electric cars, trucks, and buses is on the rise.
 And thatâ€™s good, since nearly 30% of climate-damaging emissions nationwide come from transportation. 
 (That percentage is even higher in New England states like Massachusetts.) Switching to electric cars and powering them with clean energy
  like solar and wind will slash our emissions and help us avoid the worst effects of climate change.Electric cars donâ€™t spew the 
  tailpipe pollution thatâ€™s linked to asthma, heart attacks, poor health, and premature death. Electric cars, trucks, 
  and buses also donâ€™t release unhealthy tailpipe pollution while idling in your neighborhood, stuck in traffic.
  <br><br> You can help these cars truly become the future of transportation in a few ways. To start, pledge to go 
  electric when buying your next car! As well, demand electric options at your local dealershipâ€“so you can test drive 
  one as well as purchase one the next time youâ€™re in the market for a vehicle. Additionally, share the graphic below 
  on social media so that everyone in your network can do the same.<br>

<p class="p5">A CHINESE COMPANY TO BUILD A FAKE MOON TO REPLACE THE CITY</p>
<p class="content" style="margin-top: -12px;">By Nick Mafi October 22, 2018</p>
<p class="content" style="margin-top: 12px;">Come 2020, for children living in Chengdu, China, the book Goodnight Moon may have a 
completely different meaning. Indeed, according to an article in the Peopleâ€™s Daily (a widely distributed online Chinese newspaper), 
a local company plans to build an artificial moon that, if completed,would be eight times brighter than the actual moon. <br>
<br>To address concerns about the artificial moonâ€™s affect on wildlife, a spokesman for the company said in a quote to the Peopleâ€™s 
Daily that â€œthe light of the satellite is similar to a dusk-like glow, so it should not affect animalsâ€™ routines.â€ Yet, something 
about creating a moon-like satellite that's eight times brighter than the actual moon is leaving some wondering what a â€œdusk-likeâ€ 
glow will look like.<br><br><i>contents at page 67</i></p>
